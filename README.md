# ECE-Teaching-Lab-Communication-Systems-II

Four Matlab Projects Developed by Dr. Rosa Zheng (now at Lehigh University yrz218@lehigh.edu)

1.	Information and source coding: How many bits are there in a message? Example: “Can you can a can as a canner can can a can?” 
     
2.	Media and Channels: what kind of communication channels do these systems use: your favorite TV show, Internet video gaming, autonomous cars, and dolphins?
 
3.	Channel Coding: How can you speak better than Donald Trump? 
 
4.	Modem: How are bits transmitted and received by these systems: Mars rover, Mr. and Mrs. Sat, computer hard drive, and mud pulse?
